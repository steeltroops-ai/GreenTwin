## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing, avoid `any`
- **ESLint**: Follow configured rules, zero warnings
- **Prettier**: Auto-format on save
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, camelCase names
- **Comments**: Document complex logic and APIs

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
2. Make changes with clear, atomic commits
3. Write descriptive commit messages
4. Push branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. Open Pull Request with detailed description

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples**:
- `feat(ai-coach): add predictive carbon timeline`
- `fix(extension): resolve tracking on Amazon product pages`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Test Chrome extension on multiple sites
- Verify mobile responsiveness
- Check accessibility compliance

### Performance Standards
- Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- Bundle size: Keep additions under 50KB
- API response times: < 200ms for critical paths
- Extension memory usage: < 50MB
