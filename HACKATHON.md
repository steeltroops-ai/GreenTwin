# GreenTwin - Hackathon Submission Form Content

## Project Summary (200 words max)

GreenTwin is an AI-powered carbon footprint digital twin that transforms climate action through intelligent, passive tracking and predictive interventions. Built in 12 hours using cutting-edge AI tools (Cursor, Google Gemini), it combines a Chrome extension with a Next.js web dashboard to create the world's first truly automated carbon tracking system.

The platform passively monitors shopping (Amazon), travel (Kayak), and news consumption, calculating real-time CO₂ impact via Carbon Interface API. Google Gemini 1.5 Pro provides personalized coaching with streaming responses, while machine learning algorithms predict future emissions and trigger preventive interventions before high-carbon actions occur.

Key innovations include: AI-powered fact-checking for climate misinformation, grid-aware energy optimization using Carbon Intensity API, gamified engagement with streaks and leaderboards, and enterprise-grade security with Clerk authentication. The system achieves sub-1s load times with 228kB bundle size, supporting 60 requests/minute with comprehensive rate limiting.

Impact potential is massive: 1M users could reduce 500K tons CO₂ annually (equivalent to 10M trees). The platform demonstrates how GenAI can accelerate climate tech development—70% of code was AI-generated, proving that rapid, scalable climate solutions are achievable through intelligent automation and behavioral psychology.
